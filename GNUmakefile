# Having a separate GNUmakefile lets me `include' the dynamically
# generated rules created via Makefile.maint as well as Makefile.maint itself.
# This makefile is used only if you run GNU Make.
# It is necessary if you modify files in the m4/ directory or
# want to build targets usually of interest only to the maintainer.
