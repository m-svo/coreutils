# This test would fail on solaris5.7 with tail from pre-1.22k textutils.
# The problem was that using the solaris5.7 setvbuf function to turn off
# buffering doesn't flush stdout.

# FIXME: actually, I couldn't find a way to write the test (without resorting
# to use of expect) so that it would provoke the failure on solaris5.7.
# To exercise the bug, cat's stdout seems to have to be directed
# to a terminal.
