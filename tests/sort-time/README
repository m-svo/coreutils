determine whether it's worthwhile to add a --line-length=N option to sort.
Add the option and perform this test:

Test method:
==============
for n in 80 200 400 800 3000; do
  sort a file with $n-char lines using the default of N=30
  sort the same file with --line-length=$n
  compare run times
done

do this on at least SunOS, Linux, Solaris
