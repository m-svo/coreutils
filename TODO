restore djgpp, eventually
merge TODO lists
add unit tests for lib/*.c
rewrite du.c not to use explicit recursion

strip: add an option to specify the program used to strip binaries.
  suggestion from Karl Berry

doc/coreutils.texi:
  Address this comment: FIXME: mv's behavior in this case is system-dependent
  Better still: fix the code so it's *not* system-dependent.

implement --target-directory=DIR for install (per texinfo documentation)

ls: add --format=FORMAT option that controls how each line is printed.

cp --no-preserve=X should not attempt to preserve attribute X
  reported by Andreas Schwab

printf: support %b -- consider adapting builtins/printf.def from bash

copy.c: Address the FIXME-maybe comment in copy_internal.
And once that's done, add an exclusion so that `cp --link'
no longer incurs the overhead of saving src. dev/ino and dest. filename
in the hash table.

Apply suggestion from Paul Jarc to use something along the
lines of http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/setuidgid.html to avoid
kludges (as in tests/rm/fail-2eperm) when running tests as root.

See if we can be consistent about where --verbose sends its output:
  These all send --verbose output to stdout:
    head, tail, rm, cp, mv, ln, chmod, chown, chgrp, install, ln
  These send it to stderr:
    shred mkdir split
  readlink is different

coreutils.texi: Add an entry for sort's --stable option.
