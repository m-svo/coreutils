restore djgpp, eventually
merge TODO lists
add unit tests for lib/*.c
rewrite du.c not to use explicit recursion

strip: add an option to specify the program used to strip binaries.
  suggestion from Karl Berry

doc/coreutils.texi:
  Address this comment: FIXME: mv's behavior in this case is system-dependent
  Better still: fix the code so it's *not* system-dependent.

implement --target-directory=DIR for install (per texinfo documentation)

ls: add --format=FORMAT option that controls how each line is printed.

cp --no-preserve=X should not attempt to preserve attribute X
  reported by Andreas Schwab

printf: support %b -- consider adapting builtins/printf.def from bash

copy.c: Address the FIXME-maybe comment in copy_internal.
