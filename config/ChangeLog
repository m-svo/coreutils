	Make it work even when names contain spaces or shell metachars.
	* install-sh: Write diagnostics to stderr, not stdout.
	Normalize spacing in diagnostics: use one space (not two, and not a TAB)
	after the leading `install:'.
	Add double quotes around `$src' here: $doit $instcmd "$src" "$dsttmp"

	Merge in some changes from the version in automake.
	* install-sh: Remove unnecessary quotes around `case' argument.
	Use `[ cond1 ] || [ cond2 ]' rather than `[ cond1 -o cond2 ]'.
	Use `:' rather than `true'.

	* config.guess (main): Don't use `head -1'; it's no longer portable.
        Use `sed 1q' instead.
