	* nanosleep.h (nanosleep): Guard declaration with
	`#if ! HAVE_DECL_NANOSLEEP'.
	Without this, OFS gets a redeclaration error for gnu_nanosleep, due to
	the declaration in that vendor's sys/timers.h.
	Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

	* quotearg.c (ISASCII): Add #undef and move definition to follow
	inclusion of wctype.h to work around solaris2.6 namespace pollution.
	(ISPRINT): Likewise.
	Reported by Tom Tromey.

	* readutmp.c (extract_trimmed_name): Use UT_USER instead of hard-coding
	uses of ->ut_name.  The latter doesn't work with new Linux header files
	where only utmpx.ut_user is declared.

	* readutmp.h (UT_USER): Define.

2000-01-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Remove explicit mention of
	obstack.c.

2000-01-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* strtoumax.c: [! HAVE_DECL_STRTOUL]: Declare strtoul.
	[! HAVE_DECL_STRTOULL]: Declare strtoull.
	Required for some AIX systems.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.
	[TESTING] (main): New function.

	* dirname.c (dir_name): Support for DOS-style file names with drive
	letters.

	* quotearg.c [HAVE_WCTYPE_H]: Include <wctype.h> for decl of iswprint.

	* strverscmp.c (ISDIGIT): Define.
	(strverscmp): Use ISDIGIT, not isdigit.

	* nanosleep.c (nanosleep):
	Don't use SA_INTERRUPT to decide whether to call sigaction, as
	POSIX.1 doesn't require SA_INTERRUPT and some systems
	(e.g. Solaris 7) don't define it.  Use SA_NOCLDSTOP instead;
	it's been part of POSIX.1 since day 1 (in 1988).

	* interlock: Remove unused file.  Reported by François Pinard.

2000-01-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (quotearg_buffer_restyled): Do not quote
	alert, backslash, formfeed, and vertical tab unnecessarily in
	shell quoting style.
