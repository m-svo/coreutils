	* nanosleep.c (nanosleep):
	Don't use SA_INTERRUPT to decide whether to call sigaction, as
	POSIX.1 doesn't require SA_INTERRUPT and some systems
	(e.g. Solaris 7) don't define it.  Use SA_NOCLDSTOP instead;
	it's been part of POSIX.1 since day 1 (in 1988).

	* lib/quotearg.c (quotearg_buffer_restyled): Do not quote

	shell quoting style.
