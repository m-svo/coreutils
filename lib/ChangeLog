	* lib/getpagesize.h (getpagesize): Port to VMS for Alpha;
	adapted from changes to grep getpagesize.h
	by Martin P.J. Zinser <zinser@decus.de>.

2000-02-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* userspec.c (ISDIGIT): Define it.
	(isdigit): Remove definition.
	(is_number): Use ISDIGIT, not isdigit.
	<libintl.h>: Include.
	(_ and N_): Define.
	(parse_user_spec): Mark translatable strings.

2000-02-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	With these changes, nanosleep.[ch] are finally enough like the other
	lib/* replacement files to compile on a few more losing systems.

	* nanosleep.h: Don't include config.h.
	Remove prototype from declaration of nanosleep.
	(PARAMS): Remove now-unneeded definition.
	* nanosleep.c: #undef nanosleep.
	(rpl_nanosleep): Rename from nanosleep.

2000-02-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* readutmp.c (read_utmp): Guard with `#ifdef UTMP_NAME_FUNCTION',
	rather than with `#if HAVE_UTMPNAME'.

2000-02-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* readutmp.h (UT_USER): Add parens.  From Andreas Schwab.

2000-01-31  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* nanosleep.h (nanosleep): Guard declaration with
	`#if ! HAVE_DECL_NANOSLEEP'.
	Without this, OFS gets a redeclaration error for rpl_nanosleep, due to
	the declaration in that vendor's sys/timers.h.
	Reported by Christian Krackowizer.

	* quotearg.c (ISASCII): Add #undef and move definition to follow
	inclusion of wctype.h to work around solaris2.6 namespace pollution.
	(ISPRINT): Likewise.
	Reported by Tom Tromey.

2000-01-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* readutmp.c (extract_trimmed_name): Use UT_USER instead of hard-coding
	uses of ->ut_name.  The latter doesn't work with new Linux header files
	where only utmpx.ut_user is declared.

	* readutmp.h (UT_USER): Define.

2000-01-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Remove explicit mention of
	obstack.c.

2000-01-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* strtoumax.c: [! HAVE_DECL_STRTOUL]: Declare strtoul.
	[! HAVE_DECL_STRTOULL]: Declare strtoull.
	Required for some AIX systems.  Reported by Christian Krackowizer.
	[TESTING] (main): New function.

	1997-10-17  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>
	* dirname.c (dir_name): Support for DOS-style file names with drive
	letters.

	* quotearg.c [HAVE_WCTYPE_H]: Include <wctype.h> for decl of iswprint.

	* strverscmp.c (ISDIGIT): Define.
	(strverscmp): Use ISDIGIT, not isdigit.

2000-01-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* nanosleep.c (nanosleep):
	Don't use SA_INTERRUPT to decide whether to call sigaction, as
	POSIX.1 doesn't require SA_INTERRUPT and some systems
	(e.g. Solaris 7) don't define it.  Use SA_NOCLDSTOP instead;
	it's been part of POSIX.1 since day 1 (in 1988).

2000-01-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* interlock: Remove unused file.  Reported by François Pinard.

2000-01-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (quotearg_buffer_restyled): Do not quote
	alert, backslash, formfeed, and vertical tab unnecessarily in
	shell quoting style.
