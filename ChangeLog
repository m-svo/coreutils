	* Version 4.5.1.

	* src/cat.c (main): Close STDIN_FILENO rather than a literal `0'.
	* src/tac.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tail.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tee.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tr.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/wc.c (main): Likewise.

2002-08-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/mv/setup: Rewrite not to use `: ${VAR=not_set}' paradigm.

2002-08-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/nohup.sh: Don't use "exec --"; it's not portable and
	shouldn't be needed.

2002-08-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/pr.c (main): Don't ignore -COLUMN if it's the last option.
	(usage): Clarify help text for the -COLUMN option.
	Patch by Padraig Brady.
	* tests/pr/Test.pm [col-last]: New test for the above.

	* configure.ac: Start with version 4.5.1, chosen so that it's larger
	than the latest version numbers of the component packages.

	* man/Makefile.am (check-x-vs-1): Set and export PATH so we use
	programs in ../src.

2002-08-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/date.c: Guard inclusion of <langinfo.h> with
	`#if HAVE_LANGINFO_CODESET', not `#if HAVE_LANGINFO_H'.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.
	Patch from From: GOTO Masanori.

2002-08-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix some minor time-related bugs with POSIX time arguments.
	Some valid time stamps were being rejected (notably -1, and
	time stamps before 1900 on 64-bit hosts).  And some invalid
	time stamps were being accepted, e.g. September 31.

	* src/date.c (main): Adjust to posixtime signature change.
	* src/touch.c (main): Likewise.  Remove unnecessary initialization.
	Use localtime, not posixtm, to warn about obsolete "touch".

2002-08-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add nice and pathchk1.

2002-08-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (check-README): New target/rule.
	(check): Depend on it.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add old/Makefile and old/*/Makefile.

2002-08-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add old.
	* old/: New directory, containing legacy ChangeLog* and NEWS files
	from the fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils packages.

	* src/Makefile.am (AM_INSTALLCHECK_STD_OPTIONS_EXEMPT): Set to false.

2002-08-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: uniq now obeys LC_COLLATE.

	* src/uniq.c: Include hard-locale.h, xmemcoll.h.
	(hard_LC_COLLATE): New var.
	(different): Args are now char *, not const char *.
	Use xmemcoll instead of memcmp to compare lines, so that
	LC_COLLATE has effect.  However, use memcmp if it is an
	easy locale.
	(check_file): Do not include newline in comparison, so that
	xmemcoll has a byte to stomp on temporarily.
	(main): Set hard_LC_COLLATE.

2002-07-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove djgpp, for now.

2002-07-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (uninstall-local): Search for @GNU_PACKAGE@,
	rather than the hard-coded `sh-utils'.

2002-07-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.ac: Merge the three files from fileutils,
	textutils, and sh-utils.
	* Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* src/Makefile.am: Likewise.
